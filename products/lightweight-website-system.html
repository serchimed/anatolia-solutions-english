<h3>Inherently Secure Architecture</h3><p>Static HTML architecture eliminates entire categories of vulnerabilities. SQL injection becomes physically impossible without a database. No server configuration means no firewall rules to manage, no security patches to install, and no exposed ports to protect. Cloudflare Rules let you build custom security policies like geographic blocking, browser integrity checks, and bot detection patterns tailored to your needs. DNSSEC validation ensures DNS responses haven't been tampered with during transit.</p><h3>Professional Workflow Integration</h3><p>The system enforces software engineering best practices naturally. Branch protection rules prevent direct commits to production. Pull request workflows enable peer review before content goes live. This transforms content management into a disciplined process rather than ad hoc changes that bypass oversight.</p><h3>Complete Setup and Training Included</h3><p>We handle the entire technical setup for you. This includes configuring your domain with Cloudflare nameservers, connecting your GitHub repository to Pages, enabling SSL certificates, and establishing Cloudflare Rules for your security requirements. Your system arrives ready to use with your chosen template installed and configured. If you haven't worked with HTML or JSON editing before, we provide hands on training to make you comfortable managing your content. You'll learn exactly what to edit, how to commit changes safely, and how to use version control to prevent mistakes. No prior technical experience required.</p><strong>$200.00</strong><a href="https://buy.stripe.com/3cIfZigAqbh153NfNKcQU0d" class="pay" target="_blank">Pay with Credit Card</a><div><h3>Why Should You Buy?</h3><p>Traditional websites demand constant security patches, database maintenance, and server management. Plugins need updates, frameworks create compatibility nightmares, and databases expose injection vulnerabilities. This system eliminates those problems. We configure everything for you including SSL, Cloudflare protection, and your template. If you're new to JSON or HTML, training is included. Deploy once with our setup assistance, then manage content confidently with zero ongoing maintenance.</p></div></main><footer><a href="mailto:serdar@anatolia.solutions">serdar@anatolia.solutions</a><br /><address class="EN"/><a href="tel:+1 307 288 24 45">+1 307 288 24 45</a><br />525 Randall Ave Ste 100 #543, Cheyenne<br />Wyoming 82001, United States<br /></address><address class="TR"/><a href="tel:+90 551 492 29 25">+90 551 492 29 25</a><br />Yapracik, Etimesgut<br />Ankara 06815, Türkiye<br /></address><address>Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, Local Group, Virgo Supercluster, Laniakea Supercluster, Cosmic Web, Observable Universe</address><select id="lang" onchange="window.location.href = window.location.href.replace('anatolia.solutions', this.value);"><option>Change Site Language</option><option value=anatolia.solutions>EN</option><option value=turkce.anatolia.solutions>TR</option></select></footer></body></html>
