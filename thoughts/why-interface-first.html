(Frontend-First)</h2><img class="post-image" src="/img/thoughts/why-interface-first.jpg" alt="Why Interface First? (Frontend-First)" width="700px" /><p>The frontend-first approach offers significant advantages by arranging user experience and visual consistency at the center of the development process.</p><p>First, we can defer investment in complex technical infrastructure by creating a prototype with basic functionality. Decision deferring in architecture allows users to interact with the product earlier and identify potentially unnecessary features while still in the development phase.</p><p>Early visual interface development enables us to validate real usage scenarios sooner. For example, in a financial analysis tool, a simple filtering module might be discovered to meet "data comparison" needs instead of complex algorithms. Similarly, in an e-commerce platform, understanding the priority of a "quick payment" function at an early stage allows requirements to be optimized accordingly.</p><p>The backend is shaped according to validated user needs in the interface-first approach, avoiding unnecessary API integrations or database optimizations.</p><p>Communication between developers and users becomes more efficient when it occurs through concrete screens. More precise questions can be asked, such as "How should we visualize this data on this screen?" instead of "What kind of table do you want?" Precise inquiries help create a consistent vision within the team.</p><p>Including users in the prototype phase increases their sense of ownership and resolves the question of "Is this what I needed?" from the start. It reduces potential resistance to the product.</p><p>Although early backend formation may be necessary for some systems, the frontend-first approach prioritizes user experience in most projects, breaks resistance to change, optimizes costs, and enables building the product together with the user. When properly implemented, it significantly improves both the development process and the product's success.</p>
