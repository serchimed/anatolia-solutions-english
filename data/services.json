Through guided practice, they build the skill to choose the right level of test for a given problem and balance effort across different types of testing.</p><p>By the end, developers will be able to apply TDD in their daily work, write meaningful tests that guide design decisions, and maintain confidence in their codebase as it grows. Juniors and intermediates will strengthen their foundations, while seniors will find opportunities to refine their approach and mentor others.</p><em>Learning Methodology</em><p>The workshop follows a learn–demo–practice cycle. First, participants are introduced to the principles of TDD and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. The instructor then demonstrates how to apply these principles in practice, before guiding participants through exercises where they write tests and build features themselves, often working in pairs or small groups to share insights.</p><p>Examples use familiar tools such as Visual Studio Code, xUnit, MochaJS, and Puppeteer, but these are shown only to illustrate techniques.
