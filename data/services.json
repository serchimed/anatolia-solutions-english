The session also examines the opportunities and risks AI brings, helping participants understand both its potential and its challenges.</p><p>A core part of the program focuses on the art of preparing effective prompts—the foundation of working productively with AI systems. Participants learn the anatomy of an ideal prompt, discover how to achieve powerful results with zero-hit prompts, and practice designing prompts where AI takes on roles, uses analogies, or structures information hierarchically. More advanced techniques such as chained prompts are also introduced, showing how to guide AI step by step through complex problem-solving.</p><p>Finally, the training highlights how AI can be applied creatively and analytically across different fields. Participants see how AI can extend the power of familiar tools like Excel for data analysis, serve as a digital canvas for generating compelling visual art, and even open new possibilities in music composition by creating melodies without traditional limits.</p><p>By the end of the training, participants will have a solid understanding of AI's foundations, practical skills for crafting effective prompts, and inspiration for applying AI in both analytical and creative contexts.</p>"
