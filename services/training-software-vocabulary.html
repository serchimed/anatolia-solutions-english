However, if you need proof of attendance, we can prepare a document for you.</p></details><details><summary>Can we also take it as a classroom training in addition to distance learning?</summary><p>Yes, we can also plan it as a face-to-face classroom training when the number of people is sufficient.</p></details><details><summary>May I request to retake the training?</summary><p>Yes.</p></details><details><summary>What materials are given to training participants?</summary><p>Participants will receive the Software English Study Guide and Review Practice Notebook, which include Turkish translations of 2,222 words along with sample English sentences from the software field.</p></details><details><summary>How do you teach words?</summary><p>During the course, the instructor explains English words using example sentences taken from the software world. While teaching the Turkish meaning of each word, the instructor also provides examples of how the word is used in software projects. This approach makes it easier to understand both the term itself and the context in which it is commonly used.</p></details><details><summary>Are there opportunities for practice in the training?</summary><p>Yes, there are sections during the training where participants will practice speaking.</p></details><details><summary>Is there any homework?</summary><p>Yes.

Using the study guide and the review practice notebook, you will reach a total of 2,222 words.</p></details><details><summary>Which programming languages does this course focus on?</summary><p>This training does not focus on technical aspects of programming.

At the same time, you may also learn that “multiple inheritance” is a concept that can be applied in C++.</p><p>However, the course does not go into technical details about how this works. The focus remains on language and communication.</p></details><details><summary>Who is this course ideal for?</summary><p>This training is ideal for software developers working with international teams on global projects, IT professionals seeking to communicate more effectively in cross-cultural meetings, individuals evaluating remote job opportunities, and contributors to open source projects who want to collaborate seamlessly across language and cultural barriers.</p></details><details><summary>What is the duration of the training?</summary><p>The training is 16 hours in total, but it can be adjusted based on your needs.</p></details><details><summary>Are there any prerequisites for attending the training?</summary><p>No specific prerequisites are required.
