<h3>About the Training</h3><p>This training is designed to help software professionals expand their English vocabulary and communicate more effectively in international projects. Instead of focusing on technical details, the course uses examples from the software world to explain English words in context, making it easier to understand both their meanings and how they are used in real life projects.</p><p>Through interactive online sessions, you will learn the meanings and correct pronunciations of new words, practice using them in sentences, and reinforce your knowledge with review exercises. By the end of four lessons, you will have learned 100 commonly used words with your instructor, and with the help of the Software English Study Guide and Review Practice Notebook, you will continue building your vocabulary up to 2,222 words.</p><strong>$150.00</strong><a href="https://buy.stripe.com/8wM7sT6ow6Dj5y06oo" class="pay" target="_blank">Pay with Credit Card</a><div><h3>Why Should You Buy?</h3><p>Global software opportunities require strong English communication.

However, if you need proof of attendance, we can prepare a document for you.</p></details><details><summary>Can we also take it as a classroom training in addition to distance learning?</summary><p>Yes, we can also plan it as a face-to-face classroom training when the number of people is sufficient.</p></details><details><summary>May I request to retake the training?</summary><p>Yes.</p></details><details><summary>What materials are given to training participants?</summary><p>Participants will receive the Software English Study Guide and Review Practice Notebook, which include Turkish translations of 2,222 words along with sample English sentences from the software field.</p></details><details><summary>How do you teach words?</summary><p>During the course, the instructor explains English words using example sentences taken from the software world. While teaching the Turkish meaning of each word, the instructor also provides examples of how the word is used in software projects. This approach makes it easier to understand both the term itself and the context in which it is commonly used.</p></details><details><summary>Are there opportunities for practice in the training?</summary><p>Yes, there are sections during the training where participants will practice speaking.</p></details><details><summary>Is there any homework?</summary><p>Yes. Our training begins with interactive sessions where you learn the meanings and correct pronunciations of new words.</p><p>Your homework between lessons is to complete the exercises in the review practice notebook. By the end of four lessons, you will have learned 100 words together with your teacher.</p><p>After this stage, you will continue building your vocabulary independently. Using the study guide and the review practice notebook, you will reach a total of 2,222 words.</p></details><details><summary>Which programming languages does this course focus on?</summary><p>This training does not focus on technical aspects of programming. Instead, its purpose is to expand your vocabulary so you can better understand your teammates and actively participate in business communication.</p><p>For example, consider the sentence: “In case you are adamant on using multiple inheritance, it should be done in C++.”</p><p>In our course, the word “adamant” is introduced to teach its meaning—insistent, stubborn, determined. At the same time, you may also learn that “multiple inheritance” is a concept that can be applied in C++.</p><p>However, the course does not go into technical details about how this works. The focus remains on language and communication.</p></details><details><summary>Who is this course ideal for?</summary><p>This training is ideal for software developers working with international teams on global projects, IT professionals seeking to communicate more effectively in cross cultural meetings, individuals evaluating remote job opportunities, and contributors to open source projects who want to collaborate seamlessly across language and cultural barriers.</p></details><details><summary>What is the duration of the training?</summary><p>The training is 16 hours in total, but it can be adjusted based on your needs.</p></details><details><summary>Are there any prerequisites for attending the training?</summary><p>No specific prerequisites are required. The training is suitable for all levels.</p></details></main><footer><a href="mailto:serdar@anatolia.solutions">serdar@anatolia.solutions</a><br /><address class="EN"/><a href="tel:+1 307 288 24 45">+1 307 288 24 45</a><br />525 Randall Ave Ste 100 #543, Cheyenne<br />Wyoming 82001, United States<br /></address><address class="TR"/><a href="tel:+90 551 492 29 25">+90 551 492 29 25</a><br />Yapracik, Etimesgut<br />Ankara 06815, Türkiye<br /></address><address>Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, Local Group, Virgo Supercluster, Laniakea Supercluster, Cosmic Web, Observable Universe</address><select id="lang" onchange="window.location.href = window.location.href.replace('anatolia.solutions', this.value);"><option>Change Site Language</option><option value=anatolia.solutions>EN</option><option value=turkce.anatolia.solutions>TR</option></select></footer></body></html>
