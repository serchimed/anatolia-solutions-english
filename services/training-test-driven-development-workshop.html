<h3>About the Workshop Training</h3><p>This hands on workshop teaches Test Driven Development through practical exercises with C# and JavaScript. Learn the red green refactor cycle, testing pyramid concepts, and how TDD shapes code design and development practices. Developers gain skills to write meaningful tests, choose appropriate test levels, and maintain confidence as codebases grow, especially critical when using AI assisted development tools.</p><p>The workshop follows a learn demo practice cycle. Participants learn TDD principles, watch live demonstrations, then practice through guided exercises. Working in pairs or small groups encourages knowledge sharing and collaborative problem solving.</p><p>Tools like Visual Studio Code and testing frameworks illustrate techniques that adapt to any development environment. By the end, participants confidently apply TDD practices to real projects, preventing vibe coding from destroying project quality while leveraging AI for faster development.</p><strong>$250.00</strong><a href="https://buy.stripe.com/6oU8wQbg6gBl67R9pmcQU0a" class="pay" target="_blank">Pay with Credit Card</a><div><h3>Why Should You Buy?</h3><p>AI assisted coding accelerates development but vibe coding without tests destroys projects. Master TDD to move fast without breaking things. Write reliable code that catches issues before production. Gain the disciplined testing habits that let you leverage AI tools confidently while maintaining professional code quality and preventing regressions.</p></div><h3>Questions</h3><details><summary>Is there a money-back guarantee?</summary><p>Yes.</p></details><details><summary>Will a certificate be given at the end of the training?</summary><p>No, we do not provide a certificate at the end of the training because we believe certificates and diplomas are outdated. However, if you need proof of attendance, we can prepare a document for you.</p></details><details><summary>Can we also take it as a classroom training in addition to distance learning?</summary><p>Yes, we can also plan it as a face-to-face classroom training when the number of people is sufficient.</p></details><details><summary>May I request to retake the training?</summary><p>Yes.</p></details><details><summary>Who is this course ideal for?</summary><p>This workshop is designed for software developers, engineers, and tech leads who want to improve code quality, reduce bugs, and adopt Test Driven Development practices.</p></details><details><summary>What are the technical prerequisites?</summary><p>Participants should have VS Code installed and basic programming experience in C# or JavaScript. Familiarity with basic testing concepts is helpful but not required.</p></details><details><summary>Do I need prior testing experience?</summary><p>No prior testing experience is required. The workshop starts with fundamentals and progressively builds to advanced TDD techniques with plenty of practical exercises.</p></details><details><summary>What is the workshop structure?</summary><p>The full day workshop follows three phases: theoretical TDD foundations, live instructor demonstrations with xUnit/MochaJS/Puppeteer, and hands on participant practice with guided coding tasks in VS Code.</p></details></main><footer><a href="mailto:serdar@anatolia.solutions">serdar@anatolia.solutions</a><br /><address class="EN"/><a href="tel:+1 307 288 24 45">+1 307 288 24 45</a><br />525 Randall Ave Ste 100 #543, Cheyenne<br />Wyoming 82001, United States<br /></address><address class="TR"/><a href="tel:+90 551 492 29 25">+90 551 492 29 25</a><br />Yapracik, Etimesgut<br />Ankara 06815, Türkiye<br /></address><address>Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, Local Group, Virgo Supercluster, Laniakea Supercluster, Cosmic Web, Observable Universe</address><select id="lang" onchange="window.location.href = window.location.href.replace('anatolia.solutions', this.value);"><option>Change Site Language</option><option value=anatolia.solutions>EN</option><option value=turkce.anatolia.solutions>TR</option></select></footer></body></html>
