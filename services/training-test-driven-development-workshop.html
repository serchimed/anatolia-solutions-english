<h3>About the Workshop Training</h3><em>Workshop Overview</em><p>This hands-on workshop introduces Test Driven Development in a clear and practical way. Developers work step by step through the TDD process, with examples in languages such as C# and JavaScript. The emphasis is on how TDD shapes code design, testing strategy, and everyday development practices.</p><p>Participants also explore the testing pyramid, learning how unit, integration, and end-to-end tests complement one another. Through guided practice, they build the skill to choose the right level of test for a given problem and balance effort across different types of testing.</p><p>By the end, developers will be able to apply TDD in their daily work, write meaningful tests that guide design decisions, and maintain confidence in their codebase as it grows. Juniors and intermediates will strengthen their foundations, while seniors will find opportunities to refine their approach and mentor others.</p><em>Learning Methodology</em><p>The workshop follows a learn–demo–practice cycle. First, participants are introduced to the principles of TDD and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. The instructor then demonstrates how to apply these principles in practice, before guiding participants through exercises where they write tests and build features themselves, often working in pairs or small groups to share insights.</p><p>Examples use familiar tools such as Visual Studio Code, xUnit, MochaJS, and Puppeteer, but these are shown only to illustrate techniques. Participants are encouraged to adapt TDD practices to the tools and languages they already use in their own work.</p><strong>$250.00</strong><a href="https://buy.stripe.com/6oU8wQbg6gBl67R9pmcQU0a" class="pay" target="_blank">Pay with Credit Card</a><div><h3>Why Should You Buy?</h3><p>This workshop gives developers practical experience with Test Driven Development, focusing on the habits and mindset that improve code quality over time. Participants learn through a cycle of explanation, live coding, and guided practice so they not only understand TDD concepts but also apply them with confidence in real projects.</p></div><h3>Questions</h3><details><summary>Is there a money-back guarantee?</summary><p>Yes.</p></details><details><summary>Will a certificate be given at the end of the training?</summary><p>No, we do not provide a certificate at the end of the training because we believe certificates and diplomas are outdated. However, if you need proof of attendance, we can prepare a document for you.</p></details><details><summary>Can we also take it as a classroom training in addition to distance learning?</summary><p>Yes, we can also plan it as a face-to-face classroom training when the number of people is sufficient.</p></details><details><summary>May I request to retake the training?</summary><p>Yes.</p></details><details><summary>Who is this course ideal for?</summary><p>This workshop is designed for software developers, engineers, and tech leads who want to improve code quality, reduce bugs, and adopt Test Driven Development practices.</p></details><details><summary>What are the technical prerequisites?</summary><p>Participants should have VS Code installed and basic programming experience in C# or JavaScript. Familiarity with basic testing concepts is helpful but not required.</p></details><details><summary>Do I need prior testing experience?</summary><p>No prior testing experience is required. The workshop starts with fundamentals and progressively builds to advanced TDD techniques with plenty of practical exercises.</p></details><details><summary>What is the workshop structure?</summary><p>The full-day workshop follows three phases: theoretical TDD foundations, live instructor demonstrations with xUnit/MochaJS/Puppeteer, and hands-on participant practice with guided coding tasks in VS Code.</p></details></main><footer><a href="mailto:serdar@anatolia.solutions">serdar@anatolia.solutions</a><br /><address class="EN"/><a href="tel:+1 307 288 24 45">+1 307 288 24 45</a><br />525 Randall Ave Ste 100 #543, Cheyenne<br />Wyoming 82001, United States<br /></address><address class="TR"/><a href="tel:+90 551 492 29 25">+90 551 492 29 25</a><br />Yapracik, Etimesgut<br />Ankara 06815, Türkiye<br /></address><address>Earth, Solar System, Milky Way, Local Group, Virgo Supercluster, Laniakea Supercluster, Cosmic Web, Observable Universe</address><select id="lang" onchange="window.location.href = window.location.href.replace('anatolia.solutions', this.value);"><option>Change Site Language</option><option value=anatolia.solutions>EN</option><option value=turkce.anatolia.solutions>TR</option></select></footer></body></html>
